            My Favorite Person's name is Renata de 
            Araújo Ramos (and in the future, Cerne). 
            She was born 17 years ago, in Niteroi, 
            Rio de Janeiro but, nowadays she lives 
            in Barra da Tijuca in the city of Rio.
            She is currently a high school student, 
            in the american school of Rio. Her dream 
            is move to the US, and there study, either

            <p id="textSideBySide"><strong style="color: palegoldenrod;">Her Main Qualities:</strong> Well, 
            I could easily speak for a whole day about her qualities 
            but I'll give a quick peak to the amazing person that Renata 
            is: <br><br>
            <strong>- Empathy: </strong>Rena is a very Empathic person, 
            if not the most empathic person that I have ever knew. She is the opposite of 
            self-centered, because it does not even matter is she is good or not, she will 
            make her best to help the others; <br><br>
            <strong>- Sense of humor: </strong> I personaly love her capacity to make fun of 
            everything, even when everybody is in a bad mood, she has the ability to put a 
            smile of every one face; <br><br>
            <strong>- Beauty: </strong>I don't even need to say anything about this one... I mean, 
            just take a look in the pictures of this page! <br><br>
            <strong>- Intelligence: </strong>Rena is one of the most intelligent people that I know, 
            she always has the highest grades of the class and she is also always trying to help 
            her classmates.
